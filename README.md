# Netflix-Data-Analysis-Project

This Netflix Data Analysis Project analyzes a dataset of Netflix TV Shows and Movies to uncover insights and trends. The tasks include identifying and removing duplicate records, detecting and visualizing null values, and answering various analytical questions such as finding the Show ID and Director for 'House of Cards', determining the year with the highest number of releases, counting the total number of Movies and TV Shows, listing Movies released in 2000, and identifying TV Shows released exclusively in India. The project also identifies the Top 10 Directors with the most releases, examines records where the category is 'Movie' and type is 'Comedies' or the country is the United Kingdom, counts the number of Movies/Shows featuring Tom Cruise, lists different ratings defined by Netflix, and explores specific rating-based queries. Additionally, it finds the maximum duration of a Movie/Show, identifies the country with the highest number of TV Shows, sorts the dataset by year, and filters records based on specific categories. The analysis utilizes Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, and Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration, providing insights into Netflix's content distribution, trends, and key contributors.
